Flux tokens can also be spent to enhance the effect of some Stratagems. Each time you spend a Flux token, reduce the number of Flux tokens you have by one and your opponent gains one Flux token. Whenever your opponent has one or more Flux tokens, they can spend one Flux token after an Advance roll, Hit roll, Wound roll or saving throw is made for a model or unit from their army, to re-roll the result of that roll or throw. If they do, they reduce the number of Flux tokens they have by one and you gain one Flux token. This is ignored if your opponent has the Fates in Flux Detachment rule. In your Command phase , if your opponent has one or more Flux tokens, you gain one Flux token. Designer’s Note: When using fast dice rolling , this rule can be used to spend any number of Flux tokens (up to the amount you have), to re-roll a number of dice up to the amount spent, after rolling multiple rolls or saving throws at once."
